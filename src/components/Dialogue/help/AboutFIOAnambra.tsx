        In Anambra State, the FOI law provides a legal framework for accessing
        information from state government bodies. It aims to promote openness,
        suppress corruption, and foster a culture of transparency and public
        participation in governance. Whether it's information about local
        projects, expenditures, or policy decisions, the law empowers you to
        request and receive this information.
